Reasoning of Answer [B] is: Given the table doesn’t directly state the winner or the advantages received in the 1975 National 500 race or provide explicit changes in points for each driver, we need to deduce the winner and the advantage based on differences in standings.
1. Identify the drivers and their points after the race.
2. Observe the standings positions and differentials.
- Richard Petty is listed at the top and has a 0 differential, indicating no change in leading points position after the race.
- Benny Parsons is 878 points behind Petty.
- Dave Marcis is 879 points behind Petty.
- James Hylton is 898 points behind Petty.
- The rest are further behind.
Since these data points alone don’t directly give us the winner’s name and the differential gain, we infer the race dynamics from the differential columns:
- The differential column shows how far each driver is from the leader's point. It doesn’t discuss the race’s immediate impact but reflects the standings' status post-race.
Given the complexity and lack of direct relations in the standings table, external information is typically required to conclusively determine the race winner and specific advantage directly.
However, based on historical records:
Richard Petty won the 1975 National 500.. 
Answer [B] is: Richard Petty, 0.

- Seats won by Non-party candidates: 118
- Remaining seats: 295 - 176 - 118 = 1
Therefore, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Non-party candidates won the 1951 Mongolian legislative election, with 176 and 118 seats respectively, and there was 1 remaining seat.. 
Answer [A] is: Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Non-party candidates.
Reasoning of Answer [B] is: First, observe the table to identify the relevant data points:
1. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) had 176 seats.
2. The non-party candidates had 118 seats.
3. The total number of seats was 295.
Next, determine which party won the election by identifying which party or group secured the majority of the seats. The majority is calculated as more than half of the total number of seats:
- Total seats = 295
- Majority threshold = 295 / 2 = 147.5 (since a party needs more than half, the threshold is effectively 148)
Compare the seats:
- Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party: 176 seats (which is more than 148)
- Non-party candidates: 118 seats (which is less than 148)
Thus, the MPRP won the election. The remaining seats not won by the MPRP were by the non-party candidates..
