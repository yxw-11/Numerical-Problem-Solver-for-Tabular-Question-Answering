What is the gender breakdown of households in Kot Karar?
You have 2 answers with their corresponding reasoning processes derived by two different models. Answer [A] was derived by the A model. Answer [B] was derived by B model.
Reasoning of Answer [A] is: To find the gender breakdown of households in Kot Karar, we need to calculate the number of male and female individuals per household.
Total No. of Houses: 367
Total Population: 1,858
Average population per household = Total Population / Total No. of Houses
Average population per household = 1858 / 367 ≈ 5.06
Now, we can assume that each household has approximately 5 individuals.
Number of male individuals per household = Total Male Population / Total No. of Houses
Number of male individuals per household = 954 / 367 ≈ 2.60
Number of female individuals per household = Total Female Population / Total No. of Houses
Number of female individuals per household = 904 / 367 ≈ 2.46
Therefore, the gender breakdown of households in Kot Karar is:
Final Answer: 2.60, 2.46
